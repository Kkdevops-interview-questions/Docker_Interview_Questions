## 31. How do you pull a specific version of a Docker image?

### Explanation:
Docker images are versioned using **tags**.  
You can specify a tag when pulling to get a particular version.

### Example Commands:
```bash
docker pull nginx:1.25
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
````

If no tag is mentioned, Docker pulls the **latest** tag by default.

### Real-World Example:

In our Jenkins pipeline, we pulled specific versions like `python:3.11.6` to ensure environment consistency between dev and prod environments.

## 32. How do you share images within an organization securely?

### Explanation:

You can use a **private Docker registry** such as:

* AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)
* Azure Container Registry
* Google Artifact Registry
* Self-hosted Harbor or Nexus

### Example (AWS ECR):

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
docker tag myapp:v1 <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/myapp:v1
docker push <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/myapp:v1
```

### Real-World Example:

Our organization used AWS ECR to store internal microservice images securely, with IAM authentication controlling who could push or pull.

---

## 33. What’s the purpose of health checks in a Dockerfile?

### Explanation:

`HEALTHCHECK` monitors the status of a running container and helps orchestrators (like Docker or Kubernetes) know if it’s healthy.

### Example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
```

### Real-World Example:

We added health checks to our Java app containers so Docker Compose could automatically restart unhealthy containers if the app crashed internally.

---

## 34. How do you build a Docker image from a Dockerfile?

### Explanation:

You can use the `docker build` command to create an image from a Dockerfile.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:v1 .
```

`.` specifies the current directory containing the Dockerfile.

### Real-World Example:

In our CI/CD process, Jenkins executed:

```bash
docker build -t myorg/backend:${BUILD_ID} .
```

to generate a new image version for each build.

---

## 35. How do you push Docker images to a remote registry?

### Explanation:

After building and tagging an image, you can push it to a registry like Docker Hub or ECR.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker login
docker tag myapp:v1 username/myapp:v1
docker push username/myapp:v1
```

### Real-World Example:

Once our Jenkins build completed, it automatically pushed the image to Docker Hub using service account credentials, making it ready for deployment.

---

## 36. What’s the difference between docker ps and docker ps -a?

### Explanation:

* `docker ps`: Shows only **running** containers.
* `docker ps -a`: Shows **all containers**, including stopped and exited ones.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker ps
docker ps -a
```

### Real-World Example:

When troubleshooting failed containers, we used `docker ps -a` to identify exited containers and review their logs for root cause.

---

## 37. What is an orphaned volume? How do you handle it?

### Explanation:

An **orphaned volume** is a Docker volume not attached to any container but still occupying disk space.

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker volume ls
docker volume prune
```

### Real-World Example:

After multiple container recreations in testing environments, we scheduled a weekly cleanup job using `docker volume prune` to reclaim unused disk space.

---

## 38. How do you debug a Docker build that’s failing?

### Explanation:

When a `docker build` fails, you can:

1. Use the `--progress=plain` flag to view detailed logs.
2. Add debug commands (`RUN ls -l`, `RUN echo`) in the Dockerfile.
3. Use intermediate containers with `--target` to test stages.

### Example Command:

```bash
docker build --progress=plain -t myapp .
```

### Real-World Example:

Our image build was failing due to missing `npm` dependencies.
We added `RUN npm install && npm test` inside the Dockerfile to identify missing modules.

---

## 39. How do you list all Docker networks?

### Explanation:

Use `docker network ls` to view all networks available on the host.

### Example Command:

```bash
docker network ls
```

To see details of a specific network:

```bash
docker network inspect <network_name>
```

### Real-World Example:

We regularly listed Docker networks to identify old bridge networks left by Compose projects and removed unused ones using `docker network prune`.

---

## 40. What are the differences between bridge, host, and none networks?

### Explanation:

| Network Type | Description                                                                       | Use Case                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Bridge       | Default network, provides container-to-container communication via virtual subnet | Multi-container apps      |
| Host         | Shares host’s network stack; no isolation                                         | High-performance apps     |
| None         | No networking                                                                     | Isolated computation jobs |

### Example Commands:

```bash
docker run -d --network=bridge nginx
docker run -d --network=host prometheus
docker run -d --network=none ubuntu
```

### Real-World Example:

We used the **host network** for Prometheus monitoring to reduce latency, and **bridge** for normal app communication between frontend and backend containers.
